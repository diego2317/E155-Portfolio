Soldering them to the E155 development board took approximately three hours, with the first thirty minutes spent attempting to solder the 5V regulator to the board. Figure 1 displays the completed development board.\nINSERT DEV BOARD IMAGE HERE"

    "text": "Technical Documentation\nThe source code for the project can be found in the lab 1 folder of my Github repository for E155.\n\nBlock Diagram\nFigure 2 (below) contains the block diagram used to design the combinational logic to drive the LEDs and 7-segment display.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nLED Control\nTable 1 contains the truth table used to determine the state of the LEDs.\n\n\n\ns[0]\ns[1]\nled[0]\ns[2]\ns[3]\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nOFF\n0\n0\nOFF\n\n\n1\n0\nON\n1\n0\nOFF\n\n\n0\n1\nON\n0\n1\nOFF\n\n\n1\n1\nOFF\n1\n1\nON\n\n\n\nBy inspection of figure 2, we see that led[0] is determined by s[0] XOR s[1], and led[1] is determined by s[2] AND s[3]. In order to blink led[2] at 2.4Hz, the HSOSC module was used to create a clock with a frequency of 24MHz. I then encoded a digitally controlled oscillator, using the formula f_LED = f_clk * p / 2^N. I chose values p = 430 and N = 32, theoretically producing an oscillator with a frequency of 2.403 Hz.\n\n\n7-Segment Display Control\nThe 7-segment display is controlled by a submodule that converts the input switches (s[3:0]) into a 7-bit output (s[6:0]). The submodule contains a case statement that converts each of the 16 possible 4-bit inputs into the corresponding values needed to illuminate the 7-segment display and create the corresponding hexadecimal number. Because the 7-segment display is common anode, the necessary pins are pulled to 0 to illuminate the necessary segments. For example, the input 4’h0 is converted to 7’b1000000. s[0] corresponds to segment A and s[6] corresponds to segment G of the 7-segment display. See figure 3 for the layout. \n\n\nSchematic\nI consulted the datasheet of the SOMETHING to determine which FPGA pins I would connect to the 7-segment display. The resultant schematic can be seen below.\nINSERT SCHEMATIC HERE"
