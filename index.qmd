Hi! I'm Diego Weiss, a Junior Engineering major at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu). My main interests fall in the fields of robotics, controls, and embedded systems. If I'm not locked in the basement of Harvey Mudd's engineering building, you can find me rock climbing, hiking, running, or playing soccer with my friends.
